/*
 * ANIMATIONS
 *
 * Animations are subroutines which take one argument, indicating whether they should
 * initialize themselves. In order to keep this file from becoming unreadable, each
 * animation routine is in its own file in the animations/ directory. Each animation
 * routine should keep its own variables static in order to avoid polluting the global
 * namespace and accidentally colliding with names used by other routines. Only the
 * routine name, which should start with animation_,  should be global. Add the routine
 * name to the animations[] array below to make it available to the user interface.
 *
 * Init will be called when the animation is first selected. On init the animation
 * routine should set up any state it needs in order to perform the animation (like
 * record the state of all the LEDs or set any state variables) and return.
 * 
 * When init is false, the animation routine should perform one frame of animation,
 * do any housekeeping it needs to, and return the number of milliseconds until the next
 * frame of animation.
 *
 * Animations should call FastLED.show() when they're ready to. The animation loop doesn't
 * do this for them.
 *
 * Animations should avoid calling delay() when possible and instead maintain state using
 * state variables and return the number of milliseconds till they need to resume. This
 * allows the code to also perform operations involving the network stack: service
 * commands via the web interface and MQTT and perform over-the-air-updates. Also do not use
 * FastLED's EVERY_N_MILLISECONDS() or EVERY_N_SECONDS() macros.
 *
 * Network activity will almost certainly disrupt the timing of an animation, but we
 * expect network activity to normally only happen when the user initiates a command, which
 * would change the presets or animation anyway.
 *
 * One exception is temperature updates - the code optionally supports periodically posting
 * the value of a temperature sensor to MQTT. If this is too disruptive of animations then
 * change the posting frequency to be less often.
 *
 * Animations have a speed factor - a floating point number which the frame delay is
 * divided by. Normally this is 1.0. To double the animation's speed, the speed factor
 * would be 2. To halve it, the speed factor would be 0.5. 
 *
 * Animation routines are called from a loop in leds_handle().
 *
 * They're kept in the animations array along with human-friendly names for them.
